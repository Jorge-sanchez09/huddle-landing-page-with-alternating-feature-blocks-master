### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned
- Since the page content is wrapped with a same width I made a container with a max-width, and for the header and footer I first apply the background and then put the wrapper container 
- The only thing I'm unsure about its my scss organization. I wanted to try a different approach to organize my css by diving my style code on scss partials since I think it's something very common, though I'm far from sure if the way I did was acceptable ðŸ˜“
