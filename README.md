## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned
- Since the page content is wrapped with a same width I made a container with a max-width, and for the header and footer I first apply the background and then put the wrapper container 
- One thing I'm unsure about is my scss organization. I wanted to try a different approach organizing my css by diving my style code on scss partials since I think it's something very common, though I'm far from sure if the way I did was acceptable 😓
- The other thing I wish to know more about is the description of the images, since the challenge uses a lot of images and icons, I don't really know if it's necesary to add an alt attribute with a good derscription or leaving it empty for some of the images, specially for the icons that are being added with a <i> tag
